# NewYearsChaos
It's New Year's Day and everyone's in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride! There are a number of people queued up, and each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue. Any person in the queue can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions. If two people swap positions, they still wear the same sticker denoting their original places in line. Fascinated by this chaotic queue, you decide you must know the minimum number of bribes that took place to get the queue into its current state!



The function minimumBribes must print an integer representing the minimum number of bribes necessary, or Too chaotic if the line configuration is not possible.

minimumBribes has the following parameter(s):
